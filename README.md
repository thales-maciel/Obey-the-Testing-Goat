# Obey the Testing Goat

This repo is my take on the book Test-Driven Development with Python, written by Harry J.W. Percival and published by O'Reilly Media.

The book's project uses Python 3.6 and Django 1.11 and even though It focuses on TDD while using an older version of Django, It's by far the best resource I've found to learn about web development.

You can find It available for free [right here](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/).

May the Testing Goat be with you.
